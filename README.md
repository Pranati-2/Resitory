# Resitory 

**(This is an original idea.) A browsing website for organizing free online resources into learning paths.**

## The Problem

Learning online can be challenging. Free educational resources are often scattered across the web, making it difficult to find a clear path and stay organized. Legacy browsers and platforms often have fragmented content, leading to a frustrating and inefficient learning experience.

## Features

Resitory offers a solution by providing a platform where users can:

*   **Create Learning Paths:** Curate and organize free online resources into structured courses.
*   **Consume Courses:** Easily follow learning paths created by others.
*   **Share Knowledge:** Share your own curated courses with the community, helping to educate others.
